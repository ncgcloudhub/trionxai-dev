**Dall-E Image Generation System** is used to generate images for the article. This AI model uses deep learning algorithms to create high-quality images from text inputs. If you need an image for a blog post, Dall-E will automatically generate one based on the title you enter. The generated images are sure to help reinforce your message and drive engagement with your posts.

Sage AI Content Writer works with Gutenberg, the WordPress editor. It will automatically add the generated AI-generated content right into the post using native Gutenberg blocks ( Paragraph, Image, Headings). So, it is easy to modify/update the generated content.

It also works great with WordPress Classic editor and you can generate SEO-optimized long-form content within minutes and without any hassle.

**There are no footprints added by the plugin in your article's HTML** and it will appear as it would if you had written it yourself in Gutenberg editor. This is great for **SEO** and makes it impossible for Google or other search engines to figure out that it was generated using a WordPress plugin.
